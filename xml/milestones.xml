  <description>Eta Carinae is a pair of stars with a combined luminosity more than 7 million times larger than the Sun. In the mid 19th century Eta Carinae erupted dramatically increasing in brightness. A consequence of the eruption was the formation of the Homunculus Nebula which now surrounds the system.
